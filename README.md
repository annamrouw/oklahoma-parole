Code to scrape and clean Oklahoma parole docket results


This code is used to download PDF's from https://www.ok.gov/ppb/Dockets_and_Results/index.html. The PDF's are monthly reports on the Pardon and Parole Board's parole decisions. The code is by no means perfect, and every time I run it there are a few errors that need fixing. The purpose of the code is to monthly update the dataset including all Oklahoma parole decisions since 2016. Unfortunately, the data includes personal information, which unfortunately is a by-product of persons entering the criminal justice system.
